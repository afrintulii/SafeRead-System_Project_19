# SAFE READ: Bangla Content Classification & Recommendation System

**A keyword-based classification system for political, religious, and abusive Bangla content, with recommendations based on age-appropriateness.**

##  Project Overview

The widespread availability of Bangla text content raises concerns over exposing minors to inappropriate material. To address this, **SAFE READ** classifies input text based on keyword-matching into three categories:
-  Religious
-  Political
-  Abusive
